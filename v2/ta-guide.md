ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Ajay here - I hope you had a teriffic summer! A significant amount has changed in XL site since LDOC (full changelog ðŸ‘€: [`v1.7.0...v1.10.5`](https://github.com/unc-csxl/csxl.unc.edu/compare/v1.7.0...v1.10.5)). In the time since May, the CSXL repo has gone through many changes:
* Upgrade to the latest Angular version with many new features and conventions
* Upgrade from Material 2 to the new Material 3 design system, standard to the most modern Android OS release.
* Many new features and refactors to existing features, including:
  * "My Courses" feature and Office Hours
  * Hiring of UTAs
  * *many existing features redesigned!*

The goal of this document and accompanying resources is to walk through all of these changes. ***If you will be a UTA for COMP 423 in the Fall or develop for the CSXL site, read this carefully!*** There will also be accompanying resources and videos where needed as well.

âœ¨ If you have any questions throughout, please reach out to me on the CSXL Slack! âœ¨
